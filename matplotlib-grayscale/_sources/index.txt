Matplotlib Grayscale Patch
==========================

The matplotlib grayscale patch (available at http://github.com/friedrichromstedt/matplotlib/) is a fork of the original and official matplotlib repository at github, http://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/, and aims at introducing various 
filters to the matplotlib core, enabling the matplotlib to e.g. render your figure in grayscale with a toggle-switch.

The advantage comes at the cost of a little overhead because some caching cannot be done anymore; meaning the matplotlib will be a little slower.  If you do not care about speed for your application, it will not matter.  If you do care, and
really need ``O(2)`` complexity reasoning, well, then you'll probably better off using the normal matplotlib.  I guess if you really need grayscale mode there's no or little way around this overhead.
