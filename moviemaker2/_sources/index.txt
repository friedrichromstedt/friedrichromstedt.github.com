How to proceed with this documentation
--------------------------------------

When you don't know what moviemaker2 is about, read the :ref:`Summary`.

When you want an example of how moviemaker2 works out in code, try the
:ref:`Tutorials`.  :ref:`Elements` will be good company in this, but not a
necessary prerequisite.

When you already know what moviemaker2 does, but want to know it's structured,
read :ref:`Elements`.

When you want to start your own moviemaker2 programs, but don't know really 
how to do that, the :ref:`Coding Style` might help you.  Note, this is 
especially about extending moviemaker2.

When you want to know the API of a specific part of moviemaker2, check out the 
:ref:`API`.


Notes
-----

Moviemaker2 is still in flux.  The API might still change (and it did 
sometimes quite dramatically).  So don't rely on this.

The docs are still somewhat incomplete, may you please excuse this.
